# fantastic-finale-dbucci2-retry

My final project for CS 126 is a simple one: a program that allows two opponents to play chess in Visual Studio.

## Running the program

To run the program, you will first need to clone it and open it in Visual Studio. Next, create an openFrameWorks project with the files. You will need to add ofxUIUtils to the addons of the project. The repository for ofxUIUtils can be found here: https://github.com/DomAmato/ofxUIUtils . Once all of this is done, simply run the local debugging tool and play some chess!

## Playing Chess

Simply click a piece to select it for movement, then click the space you would like to move it to. Play is turn-based, with white going first. All normal chess rules apply. Enjoy!
