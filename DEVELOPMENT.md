# My Development Process

These are the basic steps I took in working on this project.

## The External Library(ies?)

The library I am using for the chess functions can be found here: https://github.com/jeromevonk/chess_console . In addition, I ended up using an additional openFrameWorks add-on called ofxUIUtils in order to create image buttons. The repository for that can be found here: https://github.com/DomAmato/ofxUIUtils .

## The Timeline

Here is roughly how things have gone for this project. Most of the work has been done in the past week or two. To start, I familiarized myself with openFrameWorks and the basic things I would need to know how to do for my app to work, as planned. This included much research into the documentation as well as exploration into a new repository, ofxUIUtils. Next, I combed through the C++ of the chess repository I started with to understand better the functionality that went along with it. 

Then I acquired the chess board and chess pieces as photos from the web and used Microsoft Paint to isolate them with blank backgrounds. This allowed me to load the images into Visual Studio and use them both as buttons and as a chessboard. From there, I built and implemented my own framework for the pieces as ImageButtons and the chessboard as somewhat of a background. I have continued to fine-tune and debug the program from here, building out the interface in a way that complements easy piece movements and simplifies functionality with the chess repository given.

## Stretch Goals

This project took far longer than I anticipated; thus, I have not implemented the previously stated checkers functionality.
